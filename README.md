📘 Project Information: AI-Driven Code Reviewer

📝 Project Title

AI-Driven Code Reviewer


---

🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to build a system that can analyze Python/JavaScript code automatically, detect bugs, check style rules, and suggest improvements.
It acts like a mini code reviewer, helping developers improve code quality and follow best practices.


---

📌 Scope of the Project

Perform static code analysis to check for errors without executing the program.

Detect and flag unused variables, unused imports, and dead code.

Enforce style guidelines (PEP8 for Python, ESLint for JavaScript).

Provide structured review comments with line numbers and suggestions.

Optionally, extend functionality to detect duplicate code, predict runtime errors, and even auto-generate unit tests.
